### Introduction
The Boxify Sales Analysis and Inventory Insights Project employs advanced data analysis techniques to thoroughly examine sales patterns and assess inventory performance. By leveraging data-driven insights, the project highlights key factors influencing sales trends, demand fluctuations, and stock utilization. The outcomes provide actionable strategies for optimizing inventory management, reducing excess costs, improving sales forecasting accuracy, and ultimately driving greater efficiency and profitability across business operations.

### Dataset
The dataset for this project, stored in “Boxify Dataset.csv”, includes comprehensive details on orders, product information, sales performance, and inventory levels, providing a robust foundation for in-depth analysis.

### Project Files
* Boxify.docx – A detailed project documentation file that defines the requirements, objectives, and tasks. It outlines the scope of the analysis, the business problems being addressed, and the expected deliverables.

* Boxify Sales Project.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code and analysis of the Boxify dataset. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques, providing insights into sales trends and inventory performance.

### Analysis Overview

The project follows a structured approach consisting of the following steps:

* Data Collection and Preprocessing
The dataset (Boxify Dataset.csv) is imported and prepared for analysis. This stage involves handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and standardizing formats to ensure data quality and reliability.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - A comprehensive exploration of sales and inventory data is conducted to uncover meaningful patterns. This includes examining sales trends over time, identifying top-performing products and categories, and assessing stock levels to evaluate inventory effectiveness.

* Inventory Metrics Evaluation - Key inventory performance indicators such as inventory turnover ratio, stock-to-sales ratio, and reorder points are calculated. These metrics provide a deeper understanding of inventory movement, demand cycles, and replenishment needs.

* Data Visualization - Insights are translated into intuitive visual representations using charts and plots, including line graphs, bar charts, and histograms. These visualizations make it easier to interpret complex data and communicate findings effectively.


### Usage

To successfully execute the project and reproduce the results, follow the steps below:

* Ensure that Python (3.x or later) is installed on your system.
* Install the required dependencies by running: bash Copy code pip install -r requirements.txt 
* Run the Jupyter Notebook "Sales Project.ipynb" to execute the analysis and visualize the results.
* This will automatically install all necessary dependencies, including data analysis and visualization libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
* The notebook will generate descriptive statistics, visualizations, and insights into sales trends and inventory performance.

### Contributing
